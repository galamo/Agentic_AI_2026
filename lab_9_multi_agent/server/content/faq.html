<h2>What is SSO?</h2>
<p>Single Sign-On (SSO) lets users log in once and access multiple applications without entering credentials again. Our system uses a central identity provider.</p>

<section>
<h2>How does login work?</h2>
<p>Users authenticate via the identity provider. After success, they receive a session token. Permissions are loaded from the users and permissions tables and cached for the session.</p>

<h2>Project guidelines</h2>
<p>Use read-only database access for reporting. Only SELECT queries are allowed. For documentation questions, refer to this FAQ and the schema documentation.</p>

<section>
<h2>What are permissions?</h2>
<p>Permissions are named access rights (e.g. "admin", "view_reports"). They are linked to users via the users_permissions table. The audit_login table records login events.</p>
